# about me

hey, i'm nick. i've been tinkering with computers and servers since i was 16 years old. i used to run game servers when i was younger which introduced me to linux and server management. that hobby eventually spiralled into a career choice and now i'm here. i'm proficient in full-stack development with python and javascript, but i'm always looking to expand my skillset. outside of programming you can find me jamming on my bass, training at the gym, playing video games, or driving around in my jeep.
