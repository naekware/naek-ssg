# naek ssg

A simple static site generator I've made for myself. It generates the site from a set of markdown files. Pages will be named as the markdown files are named.

The config file can be passed to the program with the `--config/-c` command line argument.

Basic Usage

`python3 -m ssg --config config.json`
